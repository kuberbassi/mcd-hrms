# What Frontend Team should do

Bhaskar and Smarth, please follow these simple steps.

## Main Pages to make:
1. **Login Page**:
   - Give 2 boxes (Email and Password).
   - Give 1 button (Login).
   - Use `login(email, password)` from `backend.js`.

2. **Dashboard Page**:
   - Needs a Logout button at top.
   - Needs 4 boxes to add new staff (Name, Dept, ID, Post).
   - Needs a button to "Add Staff". Use `addStaff()` function.
   - Needs a Table to show all staff. Use `showStaff()` function.
   - Each row should have a "Delete" button.

## Important things:
- Don't make new folders, keep it simple.
- Use `App.jsx` to show either Login or Dashboard.
- Use Bootstrap classes for buttons and boxes.
