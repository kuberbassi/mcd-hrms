# What Bhaskar and Smarth should do

Please follow this simple plan to build the website pages.

## Main Pages:
1. **Login Page**:
   - Make two boxes for Email and Password.
   - Make a "Login" button.
   - Use my `login(email, password)` function.

2. **Dashboard Page**:
   - Put a "Logout" button at the top.
   - Make 4 input boxes to add new staff: Name, Dept, ID, and Post.
   - Make an "Add Staff" button and use my `addStaff()` function.
   - Make a Table to show all staff. Use my `showStaff()` function.
   - Put a "Delete" button on every row and use my `removeStaff()` function.

## Important:
- Keep it simple, don't create many folders.
- Use `App.jsx` to switch between Login and Dashboard.
- Use Bootstrap classes to make buttons and boxes look good.

Ask me if you get stuck!
