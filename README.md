# MCD Connect

This is my project for MCD staff tracking.

## Who is in the Team?
- **Bhaskar & Smarth**: Frontend (Make the website pages)
- **Kuber & Smarth**: Backend (Handle the database)
- **Kuber**: Designer (Make it look nice)
- **Akshara**: Quality & Pitch (Check for bugs and help in demo)

## How to Clone and Start?
1. Open your terminal.
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/[your-repo-link]` to get my code.
3. Type `cd mcd-connect` to enter my project folder.
4. Type `npm install` to get all the code packages I used.
5. Follow my [Firebase Setup Guide](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for database settings.
6. Type `npm run dev` to start my website!

## Files to Know
- `src/App.jsx`: The main file for the website.
- `src/backend.js`: I put all database code here.
- `src/assets/styles/index.css`: I put all colors and fonts here.
- `FRONTEND.md`: This has the plan for Bhaskar and Smarth.

## My Plan
- **Step 1**: Make the Login page.
- **Step 2**: Make the Staff list page.
- **Step 3**: Add some fake staff for the demo.
- **Step 4**: Fix all bugs and show to judges.

Ask me if you have any doubt!
