# MCD Connect

This is my project to track MCD staff members.

## Our Team
- **Bhaskar & Smarth**: Doing the frontend work.
- **Kuber & Smarth**: Doing the backend work.
- **Kuber**: Designing how it looks.
- **Akshara**: Checking bugs and helping in the demo.

## How to start?
1. Open terminal and type `npm install`.
2. Follow my [Firebase Guide](./FIREBASE_SETUP.md) for the database.
3. Type `npm run dev` to see the site.

## What's inside?
- `src/App.jsx`: The main website file.
- `src/backend.js`: All my database and login code.
- `src/assets/styles/index.css`: My styles and colors.
- `FRONTEND.md`: Read this for the frontend plan.

## My Steps
- [x] Set up folders and tools.
- [x] Finish the database code.
- [ ] Build the login and list pages.
- [ ] Add fake staff and show to judges.
